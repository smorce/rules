# Data Protection

This document provides a summary of best practices for protecting data, both at rest and in transit, with a focus on database security and privacy principles.

## Database Security

- **Network Isolation:**
  - Whenever possible, isolate database servers from direct exposure to the internet.
  - Use firewalls or security groups to restrict network access to the database to only the application servers that require it.
  - For local-only access, configure the database to listen on `localhost` instead of a public network interface.

- **Transport Layer Security (TLS):**
  - Enforce encrypted connections to the database using TLS 1.2 or higher.
  - Use certificates from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).

- **Authentication and Authorization:**
  - **Strong Credentials:** Require strong, unique passwords for all database accounts.
  - **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant each application a dedicated database account with the minimum permissions necessary for its operation. Avoid using the root or administrator account for applications.
  - **Regular Audits:** Regularly review database accounts and permissions, and remove any that are no longer needed.

- **Credential Storage:**
  - **No Hardcoded Credentials:** Never store database credentials in source code.
  - **Secrets Management:** Use a dedicated secrets management solution (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault) to store and manage database credentials.

- **Configuration and Hardening:**
  - **Regular Patching:** Keep the database software and the underlying operating system up to date with the latest security patches.
  - **Disable Unnecessary Features:** Disable any database features or services that are not required, such as sample databases or potentially dangerous stored procedures (e.g., `xp_cmdshell` in SQL Server).
  - **Auditing:** Enable database activity logging and monitoring to detect and alert on suspicious activity.

## Data Privacy Principles

- **Data Minimization:**
  - Collect and store only the data that is absolutely necessary for the functioning of the application.
  - Do not collect or store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) unless it is essential.

- **Encryption:**
  - **Encryption at Rest:** Encrypt sensitive data stored in the database.
  - **Encryption in Transit:** As mentioned above, use TLS to encrypt all data transmitted to and from the database.

- **Transparency:**
  - Be transparent with users about what data is being collected and how it is being used.

- **User Rights:**
  - Provide users with the ability to access, correct, and delete their data.

- **Secure Backups:**
  - Encrypt all database backups.
  - Store backups securely with restricted access.
  - Regularly test the backup and restore process.
